    "question": "Why do Muslims pray five times a day?",
    "answer": "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم. Muslims pray five times a day because it was prescribed by Allah in the Quran and taught by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. The five daily prayers (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha) serve as a direct connection between the worshipper and Allah. They remind Muslims of their faith throughout the day and help them maintain God-consciousness (taqwa). The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said that the five daily prayers are like a river at one's doorstep in which one bathes five times a day, cleansing away sins. صدق الله العظيم.",

    "question": "What is the importance of Zakat in Islam?",
    "answer": "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم. Zakat is one of the five pillars of Islam. It is a form of obligatory charity that serves as a way to purify one's wealth and soul. Muslims who possess wealth above a certain threshold (nisab) must give 2.5% of their qualifying wealth to specific categories of people mentioned in the Quran, primarily the poor and needy. Zakat helps in reducing inequality, promoting social welfare, and preventing the concentration of wealth. The Quran states: 'Take from their wealth a charity to purify and cleanse them' (9:103). The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ emphasized its importance by saying, 'Islam is built upon five pillars: testifying that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, performing the prayers, paying the Zakat, making the pilgrimage to the House, and fasting in Ramadan.' صدق الله العظيم.",

    "question": "How should Muslims deal with hardship and suffering?",
    "answer": "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم. In Islam, hardship and suffering are seen as tests from Allah that can strengthen faith, expiate sins, and elevate one's spiritual rank. The Quran says: 'And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient' (2:155). Muslims are encouraged to respond to hardship with patience (sabr), prayer, and trust in Allah's wisdom and mercy. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said: 'How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for his affairs are all good, and this applies to no one but the believer. If something good happens to him, he is thankful for it and that is good for him. If something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience and that is good for him.' (Muslim) Muslims are also encouraged to take practical steps to alleviate suffering while maintaining their trust in Allah. صدق الله العظيم.",

    "question": "What does Islam say about seeking knowledge?",
    "answer": "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم. Islam places a high value on seeking knowledge. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said, 'Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.' The first word revealed in the Quran was 'Read' (Iqra), emphasizing the importance of learning. Islam encourages Muslims to seek both religious and worldly knowledge that benefits humanity. The Quran frequently calls on believers to reflect, ponder, and use their intellect. The Prophet ﷺ also said, 'Whoever takes a path to seek knowledge, Allah makes the path to Paradise easy for him.' Islamic civilization has a rich history of scholarship and scientific advancement, reflecting this core value. Muslims are encouraged to pursue education throughout their lives, regardless of age or gender. صدق الله العظيم.",

    "question": "What is the Islamic view on respecting parents?",
    "answer": "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم. In Islam, respecting and honoring parents is considered one of the most important virtues, second only to worshipping Allah alone. The Quran mentions: 'Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you be kind to parents. Whether one or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of contempt, nor repel them, but address them in terms of honor' (17:23-24). Islam teaches that the pleasure of Allah is in the pleasure of the parents, and His displeasure is in their displeasure. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ emphasized the high status of mothers in particular, stating that 'Paradise lies at the feet of your mother.' Children are obligated to show kindness, respect, and obedience to their parents, care for them in old age, and pray for them. This obligation remains even if the parents are non-Muslims, though obedience is not required if they command something against Islamic teachings. صدق الله العظيم.",

    "question": "What is the significance of Ramadan in Islam?",
    "answer": "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar and holds great significance in Islam. It is the month in which the Quran was first revealed to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Fasting during Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam. Muslims abstain from food, drink, and marital relations from dawn until sunset. Beyond physical abstention, Ramadan is a time for spiritual reflection, increased prayer, charity, and recitation of the Quran. The Night of Power (Laylat al-Qadr), believed to be one of the odd-numbered nights in the last ten days of Ramadan, is considered better than a thousand months in terms of blessings and mercy. Ramadan concludes with the celebration of Eid al-Fitr. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said: 'When Ramadan begins, the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Hell are closed, and the devils are chained.' Fasting teaches self-discipline, empathy for the less fortunate, and gratitude for Allah's blessings. صدق الله العظيم.",

    "question": "What does Islam teach about honesty and truthfulness?",
    "answer": "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم. Islam places great emphasis on honesty and truthfulness (sidq) in all aspects of life. The Quran repeatedly commands believers to be truthful, and the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was known as 'Al-Sadiq' (the truthful) even before receiving revelation. He said: 'Truthfulness leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to Paradise. A person continues to tell the truth until he is recorded with Allah as a truthful person. And lying leads to wickedness, and wickedness leads to the Fire. A person continues to tell lies until he is recorded with Allah as a liar.' (Bukhari and Muslim). Islam teaches that honesty in speech, business transactions, and all dealings is essential for a just and harmonious society. Muslims are encouraged to be honest even when it is difficult or disadvantageous, as it is a sign of strong faith and moral character. The Quran states: 'O you who believe! Fear Allah and be with those who are truthful' (9:119). صدق الله العظيم.",

    "question": "What is the Islamic perspective on patience?",
    "answer": "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم. Patience (sabr) is highly valued in Islam and is mentioned over 90 times in the Quran. It is considered one of the most important virtues a Muslim can have. The Quran states: 'O you who believe, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient' (2:153). Patience in Islam encompasses several dimensions: steadfastness in obeying Allah's commands, restraint from prohibited actions, and endurance during trials and hardships. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said: 'How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for his affairs are all good. If something good happens to him, he is thankful for it and that is good for him. If something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience and that is good for him' (Muslim). Islam teaches that patience is rewarded abundantly, as Allah says: 'Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account [i.e., without measure]' (39:10). Patience is seen not as passive resignation but as active perseverance with trust in Allah's wisdom and mercy. صدق الله العظيم.",

    "question": "What is the importance of charity in Islam?",
    "answer": "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم. Charity holds a central place in Islam and is considered a fundamental aspect of faith. There are two main forms of charity in Islam: Zakat (obligatory charity) and Sadaqah (voluntary charity). Zakat, one of the five pillars of Islam, requires Muslims to give 2.5% of their qualifying wealth annually to specific categories of people in need. Sadaqah encompasses all voluntary acts of giving, including non-monetary forms like kind words or helpful actions. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said: 'Charity does not decrease wealth,' emphasizing that giving leads to blessings rather than loss. The Quran states: 'Those who spend their wealth [in Allah's way] by night and by day, secretly and publicly - they will have their reward with their Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve' (2:274). Islam teaches that charity purifies wealth, reduces inequality, fosters compassion, and strengthens community bonds. The Prophet ﷺ also emphasized that even small acts of charity are valuable, saying: 'Protect yourself from Hellfire, even with half a date [in charity].' صدق الله العظيم.",

    "question": "What does Islam say about caring for the environment?",
    "answer": "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم. Islam promotes environmental stewardship and conservation as religious obligations. Muslims are considered khalifah (vicegerents) on Earth, entrusted with its care and sustainable use. The Quran states: 'And do not cause corruption on the Earth after it has been set in order' (7:56). The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ encouraged planting trees, saying: 'If the Hour (the day of Resurrection) is about to be established and one of you is holding a palm shoot, let him take advantage of even one second before the Hour is established to plant it.' He prohibited waste of natural resources, even when performing ablution from a flowing river, and established protected areas (hima) for conservation. Islam teaches that animals have rights and should be treated with compassion. The Prophet ﷺ said: 'There is a reward for serving any living being.' Islamic principles of moderation (wasatiyyah), balance (mizan), and avoiding waste (israf) all support environmental protection. Muslims are encouraged to see the natural world as filled with signs of Allah's creation and to protect it as an act of faith. صدق الله العظيم.",
